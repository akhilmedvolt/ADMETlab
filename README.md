# ADMETlab
A platform for systematic ADME evaluation of drug molecules, thereby accelerating the drug discovery process.<br>
The platform is avaliable at: http://admetlab.scbdd.com 

## Features
1. Well optimized SAR models with better performance than state-of-the-art models.
2. User-friendly interface and easy to use.
3. Support batch computation.
4. Systematically evaluate molecular druggability.
5. Provide constructive suggestions for molecular optimization.

## About this repository.
This repository provides models of ADMETlab in binary files for expert users. The ordinary users are suggested to use the ADMETlab server to accomplish all related prediction or analysis tasks because of the convenience and no programming requirements.

The expert users could download these models to carry out further research. The example folder contains an example. In the Python command line, input:
<br>
> python run.py
<br>
and you could get the results.

## About the algorithms and explanation.
The modeling process including descriptors, methods, feature selection, model performance has been detailedly described in the “Documentation” section of the website.
